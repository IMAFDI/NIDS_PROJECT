Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) Code Explanation
This Python code implements a basic Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) that captures network packets, performs signature-based and anomaly-based detection, and logs/alerts potential intrusions.

Imported Modules
The code imports the following modules:

packet_capture: responsible for capturing network packets
signature_detection: performs signature-based detection
anomaly_detection: performs anomaly-based detection
logging_alerting: handles logging and alerting of potential intrusions
cli: not used in this code snippet ( likely a command-line interface module)
logging: Python's built-in logging module
Configuration and Setup
The code sets up logging configuration with a basic level of INFO using logging.basicConfig().

The load_configurations() function loads two configuration files:

rules.json: contains signature detection rules
anomaly_thresholds.json: contains anomaly detection thresholds
These configurations are loaded into the rules and thresholds variables, respectively.

Packet Capture
The capture_packets() function captures network packets using the packet_capture module. It takes two arguments:

interface: the network interface to capture packets from (e.g., 'Realtek RTL8822CE 802.11ac PCIe Adapter')
count: the number of packets to capture (set to 100 in this example)
Detection and Alerting
The code performs two types of detection:

Signature-based detection: The perform_signature_detection() function uses the signature_detection module to detect signatures in the captured packets. If a signature match is found, it logs and alerts an intrusion.
Anomaly-based detection: The perform_anomaly_detection() function uses the anomaly_detection module to detect anomalies in the captured packets. If an anomaly is detected, it logs and alerts an intrusion.
Main Function
The main() function orchestrates the entire process:

Loads configuration files using load_configurations().
Captures packets using capture_packets().
Performs signature-based and anomaly-based detection using perform_signature_detection() and perform_anomaly_detection(), respectively.
Logs the results using logging.info().
Example Use Case
To use this code, simply run the script. It will capture 100 packets from the specified network interface, perform signature-based and anomaly-based detection, and log/alert any potential intrusions.

Note that this code assumes the existence of the packet_capture, signature_detection, anomaly_detection, and logging_alerting modules, which are not provided in this snippet. You will need to implement these modules or modify the code to use alternative libraries or frameworks.
